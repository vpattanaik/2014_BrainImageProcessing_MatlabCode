### Abstract
Cerebrovascular system is a complex network of vessels that supply vital nutrients and oxygen to the brain. Like any other body part it is vulnerable to bleeding, infection, blood clot and other forms of damage. These damages in brain functioning require brain surgery. The main problem with such surgeries on brain blood vessels is that in most cases, place of operation cannot be accessed directly. Therefore alternative entry points and paths have to be discovered. The proposed system is designed to help doctors/surgeons find the shortest distance between two points in brain blood vessel system, using image processing and path finding techniques over MRA images.
